this uses a causal field to spread position information over time
- this avoids creating a time window of track information:
    - a time window could have multiple entries from a single track or miss a track entirely
    - tracks can come in at any time
- diffusing track information causally allows for:
    - the calculation of position flow with respect to time
        - by first calculating the position gradient over position
    - old tracks decay and spread out as we trust them less.
